  <summary>How does the platform identify Returning Users?
  </summary>

 
Identifying returning users primarily depends on the identity provided by the interaction channel. If the interaction channel provides a unique identifier for every user, then the platform will use this identity to determine new and returning users. This identity can be an email address, phone number, or any identity. If the channel provides a random identity for every interaction, then the platform will not be able to identify when the same user returns at a later date.
