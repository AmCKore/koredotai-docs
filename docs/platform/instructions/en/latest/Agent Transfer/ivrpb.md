Kore.ai XO Platform now supports integration with IVR Agent System to handover the conversations without having to use the BotKit.
  
Please visit Deploy → Channels → IVR → Configurations to enable IVR. 
  
After you have successfully established a connection with IVR, Kore.ai XO platform moves the IVR agent system into the configured state. No additional configuration is required.
